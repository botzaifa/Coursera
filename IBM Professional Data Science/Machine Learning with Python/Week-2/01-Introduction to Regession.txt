Regression is the Process of predicting a continuous value 

Key point is that our dependent vlaue should be continuous and cannot be discrete value

Types of regression Models:
1. Simple regression
	a. Simple Linear regression
	b. Simple Non-Linear regression
eg: Predict co2emission vs EngineSize of all cars

2. Multiple Regression:
	a. Multiple Linear regression
	b. Multiple Non-Linear regression
eg: Predict co2emission vs Engine size and Cylinders of all cars

Applications of Regression:
1. Sales Forecasting: 
Predict a sales preson's total yearly sales from independent variables such as age, education, and years of experience. 

2. Satisfaction analysis:
Determine individual satisfation based on demographic and psychological factors.

3. Price estimation: 
Predict the price of house in an area based on its size, no of bedrooms, etc.

4. Employment income:
Predict hours of work, education, occupation, sex, agem years of experience etx.

5. Many other domains such as Finance, Healthcare, retail, etc. 

Regession Algorithms:
1. Ordinal regression
2. Poisson regression
3. Fast forest quantile regression
4. Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge regression
5. Bayesian linear regression
6. Neural network regression
7. Decision forest regression
8. Boosted decision tree regression
9. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
