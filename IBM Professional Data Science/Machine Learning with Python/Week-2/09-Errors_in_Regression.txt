Error in Regression:
The error in regression is the difference between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm.

Multiple Ways of Errors:
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Absolute Value of the Errors and is easiest to understand.

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
It focuses towards large errors, due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Square root of MSE. It is popular since it is interpretable in the same units as the response vector or Y units, making it easy to relate its information.

4. Relative Absolute Error (RAE)
It takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor.

5. Relative Squared Error (RSE)
It is similar to RAE but is widely adopted by the data science community as it is used for calculating R-squared.


R-Squared:
It is not an error but is a popular metric for the accuracy of your model. It represents how close the data values are to the fitted regression line. The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data.
